##  Objective

To develop an **interactive Big Data dashboard** that supports:

-  Large-scale data ingestion and distributed processing  
-  Air quality analytics for **2016–2025**  
-  Geographical, seasonal, daily, and pollutant-level insights  
-  Machine learning–based forecasting  
-  Real-time visualization through **Streamlit**
